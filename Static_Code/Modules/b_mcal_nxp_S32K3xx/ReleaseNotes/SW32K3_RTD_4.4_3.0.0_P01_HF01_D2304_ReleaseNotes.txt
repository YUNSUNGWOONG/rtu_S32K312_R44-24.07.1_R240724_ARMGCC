        it already configured and ready to use. New S32DS project wizard and New S32DS project
        from Example can be used to create S32 RTD based projects.

    installation target directory and a selected EB Tresos installation. If you choose not to
    create a link, you can later create one manually or you can copy all "<mod>_TS_T40D34M30I0R0"
    directories and .JAR files to the "<Tresos Install Path>\plugins" directory.
